# AirBnB-clone - The console

## Implementing a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building a full web application.

What’s a command interpreter?

It’s a CLI but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

    - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    - Update attributes of an object
    - Destroy an object

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console (or command interpreter) will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## How to use it
It can work in two different modes:


**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.

In **Interactive mode**, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

In **Non-interactive mode**, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.


```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

## Format of Command Input

In order to give commands to the console, these will need to be piped through an echo in case of  **Non-interactive mode**.

In  **Interactive Mode**  the commands will need to be written with a keyboard when the prompt appears and will be recognized when an enter key is pressed (new line). As soon as this happens, the console will attempt to execute the command through several means or will show an error message if the command didn't run successfully. In this mode, the console can be exited using the **CTRL + D** combination,  **CTRL + C**, or the command **quit** or **EOF**.

## Arguments

Most commands have several options or arguments that can be used when executing the program. In order for the Shell to recognize those parameters, the user must separate everything with spaces.

Example:

```

user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create BaseModel
49faff9a-6318-451f-87b6-910505c55907
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py

```

or

```
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py $ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
e37ebcd3-f8e1-4c1f-8095-7a019070b1fa
(hbnb)
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
```

## Available commands and what they do

The recognizable commands by the interpreter are the following:

|Command| Description |
|--|--|
| **quit or EOF** | Exits the program |
| **Usage** | By itself |
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **help** | Provides a text describing how to use a command.  |
| **Usage** | By itself --or-- **help <command\>** |
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **create** | Creates a new instance of a valid `Class`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the `id`.  Valid classes are: BaseModel, User, State, City, Amenity, Place, Review. |
| **Usage** | **create <class name\>**|
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **show** | Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and `id`  |
| **Usage** | **show <class name\> <id\>** --or-- **<class name\>.show(<id\>)**|
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **destroy** | Deletes an instance based on the class name and `id` (saves the change into a JSON file).  |
| **Usage** | **destroy <class name\> <id\>** --or-- **<class name>.destroy(<id>)** |
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **all** | Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name.  |
| **Usage** | By itself or **all <class name\>** --or-- **<class name\>.all()** |
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **update** | Updates an instance based on the class name and `id` by adding or updating attribute (saves the changes into a JSON file).  |
| **Usage** | **update <class name\> <id\> <attribute name\> "<attribute value\>"** ---or--- **<class name\>.update(<id\>, <attribute name\>, <attribute value\>)** --or-- **<class name\>.update(<id\>, <dictionary representation\>)**|
| **-----** | **-----** |
| **count** | Retrieve the number of instances of a class.  |
| **Usage** | **<class name\>.count()** |
